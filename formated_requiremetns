üß© Step 1: Define the Goal / Vision

Goal:
A web app that helps users learn sight words through interactive flashcards, tracking progress and providing insights into learning patterns.

Primary users:

Kids or learners trying to master sight words

Parents/teachers who might help manage decks

üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Step 2: Identify Stakeholders
Stakeholder	Role / Interest
Learner (User)	Uses flashcards, tracks progress
Parent/Teacher (Optional)	Adds words/decks, monitors progress
Developer/Admin	Maintains app, adds new features
üß† Step 3: Functional Requirements (What the system must do)

Let‚Äôs break them into modules:

1Ô∏è‚É£ User Management

Create and maintain user profiles (name, age, etc.)

Store each user‚Äôs learning history and progress

Optional: Login system (username/password or localStorage-based simple profile)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Flashcard Module

Show one word per card

User can:

Mark ‚ÄúI know this‚Äù (‚úÖ / Space / Enter)

Mark ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know this‚Äù (‚ùå / skip button)

Move to next card automatically

3Ô∏è‚É£ Word Management

Add new sight words manually

Import pre-defined sight word lists (optional future feature)

Organize words into decks or categories

4Ô∏è‚É£ Learning History & Progress Tracking

Track for each user:

Words shown

Correct/incorrect attempts

Date/time of last attempt

Maintain stats:

% accuracy per deck

Words most often missed

Words fully learned (e.g., 3 correct in a row)

Detect the difficulty level based on the card

5Ô∏è‚É£ Deck Management

Auto-generate random decks:

Based on number of cards requested

Can mix learned/unlearned words

Allow manual creation of decks by user

6Ô∏è‚É£ Reports & Analysis

Dashboard:

Total words learned

Words needing revision

Accuracy over time

Visual charts (bar or pie chart for analysis)

7Ô∏è‚É£ UI/UX Requirements

Simple, kid-friendly interface

Keyboard shortcuts (space/enter)

Option for light/dark mode (optional)

Responsive design for mobile/tablet

‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Non-Functional Requirements
Type	Description
Performance	Fast card flipping and minimal lag
Persistence	Store user data locally (localStorage) or in backend DB
Scalability	Should handle multiple users and decks
Usability	Clean, minimal, easy for children
Security	Protect user profiles (if online login used)
Portability	Works on web and mobile browsers
